# Physics and Rheology of Complex Fluids


Welcome to the Physics and Rheology of Complex Fluids (PRO-CF) group at Northeastern University! Our research focuses on computational methods for studying rheology -- the science of complex fluids. We use computational modeling, network science, and machine learning techniques to study and predict the properties of complex and structured fluids.
