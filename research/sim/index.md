In Our lab we dive deep into the fascinating world of colloidal gels. Our research primarily focuses on understanding the intricate structures and rheological behaviors of colloidal suspensions. Through meticulous research, we explore how various modifications affect the rheology of colloidal suspensions.
Our work encompasses several key projects:

# Physics and rheology of colloids


Our research focuses on the physics and rheology of colloids, employing computational techniques like Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD) to understand diverse rheological responses and structural properties, including critical transition points, effects of particle size variations, and interparticle attraction strengths. Through simulations, we gain insights into particle interactions, flow dynamics, and frictional properties evolution, aiming to optimize crystalline structure formation in colloids under pressure-driven and shear-driven flows in specific geometries.

# Dense suspensions

We investigate the rheological complexities of dense suspensions under shear, focusing on their non-Newtonian behavior such as continuous and discontinuous shear-thickening. Through meticulous simulations considering particle characteristics, we uncover the microscopic origins of frictional forces within these suspensions. Exploring variations in particle shapes and geometries, we elucidate the interplay between repulsive interactions and the onset of shear thickening. Additionally, our study emphasizes the importance of a hydrodynamics-based computational model, revealing how lubrication forces in interparticle gaps lead to hydroclusters that enhance viscosity. This highlights the pivotal role of these lubrication stresses, inversely scaled with particle surface separation, in shaping the overall rheology of dense suspensions. In another study on "yielding in colloidal gels," we found a significant correlation between edge-betweenness centrality (EBC) and bond failure tendency, offering valuable insights into gelation processes.

# Emergence of rigidity

We study the fascinating emergence of rigidity in attractive colloidal gels, focusing on the intimate relationship between their network structure and mechanical properties. Utilizing network science techniques, we precisely identify colloidal clusters within the gel network, enabling a deeper understanding of their elastic response. We observe a direct correlation between the elasticity of gels and the robustness of their cluster networks, particularly noting the resilience of gels formed under stronger attraction. Our study underscores the importance of identifying particle clusters in comprehending the rigidity of colloidal gels, attributing the onset of rigidity to the development of fractal particle clusters that form a
cohesive network. This network-centric perspective sheds light on the solid-like characteristics of colloidal gels and facilitates the integration of microstructure with material properties.

Our goal is to push the boundaries of colloidal physics, paving the way for the creation of materials with novel properties. By integrating our deep understanding of colloidal behavior with innovative research techniques, we strive to uncover new insights and applications for colloidal systems, while simultaneously creating guidelines to expand the understanding of colloidal suspensions and their rheological behavior. These guidelines will provide valuable insights to experimentalists, empowering them to create better materials and applications.
