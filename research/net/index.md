We use network science to study the structural origins of rheological properties. The relationship between stress and deformation in particulate systems is directly linked to their underlying microstructure and particle dynamics. However, these systems are disordered, which makes it hard to identify structural features and track their effects. Network science provides a suite of tools to help us solve this challenge. By representing the entire system of interacting particles as a network, we are able to study their collective behavior and reveal previously hidden details that link the micro and macro scales. The goal of this research is to understand these relationships well enough to establish new tools for designing rheological properties from particle microstructure.

# Topology of particulate networks

We use network topology to study how rigidity and plasticity emerge from particle interactions. This approach has allowed us to predict dynamic properties, like gel elasticity, using only static information about the particle structure. We also use topological information to develop coarse-graining methods in line with the fractal and hierarchical nature of colloidal structures, allowing us to dynamically group these systems into networks of clusters. Many of these projects are done in collaboration with experimentalists, who pair our particle simulations with confocal imaging and analysis of real world colloidal networks.

# Networks in transition

The formation and breaking of colloidal networks are key features of their rheological response under flow. We study these dynamic processes by looking at the force networks that connect interacting particles in simulation. This has allowed us to identify the structural changes that bring about shear thickening in dense suspensions and yielding and rate-dependent rheology in colloidal gels. We use this information to study the physics that drives these processes, and to make predictions about new systems' rheology using network analysis.
