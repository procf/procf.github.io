As a computational lab, we do a lot of machine learning simulations in rheology. But there is more to it.

# Physics-inspired surrogate models


Imagine you have a structured material in hand, interested in understanding its properties such as viscosity and elastic modulus. Typically, obtaining the entire material properties requires rheometry, a process that is resource- and time-consuming. However, machine learning techniques can serve as surrogate models, potentially replacing or complementing rheometry by representing material properties. By embedding a physical law governing the structured material, it's possible to use just a fraction of rheometric data to recover the entire parametric space of the properties. The challenge lies in the imposition of the governing equation. When this equation is fully understood and given, rheometric measurements can be entirely replaced. However, if the equation is missing, we face a more traditional machine learning task. The reality often falls somewhere in between, with some data and some physics available. This scenario particularly benefits from physics-inspired surrogate models, which leverage both available data and physical laws to represent material properties efficiently.
