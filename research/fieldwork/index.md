# <i class="fas fieldwork"></i>Field work


In addition to lots of statistics and math, our lab also conducts some field work. Currently, we have a project in coastal New Hampshire. We are deploying a set of underwater cameras, some with bait (a BRUV - baited remote underwater video) and some without bait (a RUV), to track fish and invertebrates. The video allows us to monitor various populations, and to study animal behavior, without needing to scuba dive or catch any organisms. This helps reduce costs and is less invasive. This work is funded by New Hampshire Sea Grant and the School of Marine Science and Ocean Engineering. 

We are currently deploying these underwater cameras at Appledore Island in collaboration with the Shoals Marine Lab, within Great Bay at oyster farms and restoration sites, and at the Coastal Marine Lab.
