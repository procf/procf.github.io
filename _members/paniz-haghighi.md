Paniz Haghighi, a Ph.D. student, is dedicated to unraveling the complexities of colloidal gels. Her research specifically explores the formation and evolution of colloidal networks during gelation and coarsening, with the purpose of optimizing gel properties. Emphasizing the crucial role of the critical percolation point in the second-order phase transition, Paniz's work contributes to advancing our understanding of these intricate processes.
