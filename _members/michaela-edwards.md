Michaela Edwards (she/her/hers) is a marine biology student studying interspecific interactions with an emphasis on behavioral responses and invasive species. She is co-advised by both Easton White and [Brittany Jellison](https://colsa.unh.edu/person/brittany-jellison). For her master’s program, she focuses on Eastern oysters (Crassostrea virginica) behavioral responses to various interactions with invasive European green crabs (Carcinus maenas). European green crabs populations along the New England coast are currently thriving, and European green crabs are known to consume oysters. Knowing how Eastern oysters react to various interactions with this invasive predator is projected to help the oyster population and those who rely on the oyster industry. 

Michaela attended the University of New Hampshire for her undergraduate degree. She graduated from UNH with a B.S. in Marine, Estuarine, and Freshwater Biology in 2023. In her undergraduate degree, Michaela joined Dr. Brittany Jellison’s lab as an intern in her Junior year. When she first joined the Jellison lab, Michaela looked at morphological features of blue mussels that were subjects in a previous study looking at warming, ocean acidification, and predatory factors influencing the blue mussels. This internship blossomed many interests for her—specifically morphological and physiological alterations under different conditions and interspecific interactions with a narrower focus on predator-prey relationships. 

During Michaela’s free time, she loves hiking with her dogs and being around the water, whether it be for tide-pooling or snorkeling.
