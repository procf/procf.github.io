Danielle Fradet (she/her/hers) is pursuing a M.S. in Integrative Biology at the University of New Hampshire co-advised by Easton White and [Laura Kloepper](https://www.kloepperlab.net/). Her research interests include the acoustic ecology of birds and the conservation potential of private lands. Her current work focuses on building a model to determine breeding phenology of Adélie penguins in Antarctica based off their acoustic behavior. 

Before joining UNH, she graduated with a B.S. in Wildlife, Fish, & Conservation Biology from UC Davis in 2020. Danielle interned for four years as an undergraduate at the [UC Davis Museum of Wildlife and Fish Biology (MWFB)](https://mwfb.ucdavis.edu/) and worked as a Junior Specialist at MWFB for three years post-graduation. Here, she prepared over 300 specimens across all four vertebrate taxa, managed a research program on a private duck club in the Sacramento Valley, conducted terrestrial vertebrate biomonitoring for California Department of Water Resource’s Delta Levees Program, and contributed significantly to the MWFB’s Sacramento Valley Avian Bioinventory. Her relationship continues with MWFB as a graduate research affiliate. 

In her free time, Danielle enjoys birding, hiking, reading, baking, and spending time with her friends and family.
