As a seasoned Modeling and Simulation Consultant with Dassault Systemes, my expertise is rooted in a strong academic foundation, underscored by a PhD from Northeastern University. My doctoral research delved into blood rheology and its applications in medical simulations, laying the groundwork for my current role where I leverage advanced simulation to solve complex problems and drive efficiency for clients. This synergy of academic excellence and practical consultancy defines my professional journey and underscores the robust analytical skills I offer in the field.
