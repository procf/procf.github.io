Milad Saadat, currently a third-year Ph.D. candidate in the Mechanical and Industrial Engineering department, is immersed in research focused on data-driven solutions in mathematics and material design and discovery. Recognized for his academic endeavors, Milad was honored with the prestigious "2022 John and Katharine Cipolla PhD Merit Award."

With a strong background in thermofluid sciences and numerical techniques, his research centers on two key areas:

1. **Physics-Informed Machine Learning for Material Discovery:**
   * Applying physics-informed surrogate models for replicating rheometry and minimizing the experimental workload (digital twins).
   * Concentrating on pioneering methodologies for modeling and predicting material behavior.

2. **Innovative Approaches to Tackle Complex Equations:**
   * Introducing inventive techniques for solving diverse equations, including fractional integro-differential equations in both forward and inverse directions.
   * harnessing machine learning for effective solutions to traditionally intricate mathematical problems.

Milad is enthusiastic about fostering new ideas and collaborations. Feel free to reach out if you are interested in exploring novel research directions or working together on innovative projects.
