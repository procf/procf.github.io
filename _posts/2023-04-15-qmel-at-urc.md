We were thrilled to have a two students present their work at the 2023 UNH Undergraduate Research Conference. Both students were co-supervised with [Dr. Brittany Jellison](https://brittanyjellison.wixsite.com/research). The student presentations were focused on developing and applying our oyster biosensor technology to study oyster responses to predators. The biosensors measure the gaping (opening and closing) behavior of oysters. Michaela Edwards (Marine Biology, BS) focused on the biological applications of the technology that was built by Nicholas Pitkin (Mechanical Engineering, BS).

This summer we will be rolling out this technology into field settings, including at local farms and oyster restoration sets.
