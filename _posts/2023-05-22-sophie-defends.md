We are really proud of QMEL member [Sophie Wulfing](https://quantmarineecolab.github.io/members/sophie-wulfing.html) for defending her MS today! Her work involved building mathematical models of octopus fisheries in Madagascar. You can read her chapter 1 work as it is already out as a preprint.

[Sophie Wulfing, Ahilya Sudarshan Kadba, Mez Baker-MÃ©dard, and Easton R. White. Using mechanistic models to assess temporary closure strategies for small scale fisheries](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.04.28.537864v1)

Sophie is also finishing up a manuscript on incorporating human behavior, and social hierarchies, in natural resource models. She even presented this work at the Ecological Modelling Conference in Toronto.

Sophie will continue working in the lab this summer, but she will soon be off to Indonesia on a prestigious [Fulbright Scholarship](https://us.fulbrightonline.org/applicants/getting-started) to study mangrove fisheries. 

Congrats Sophie!
