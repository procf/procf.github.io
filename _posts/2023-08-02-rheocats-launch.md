Rob Campbell's Rheology Comics launched it's first issue this week at the International Congress on Rheology (ICR) in Athens, Greece.

The Rheology Comics project is a new project funded by the Society of Rheology's Rheology Venture Fund. Rob started this project to create a short series of comics that help readers connect with the joys of rheology. The first issue, “Rheology of Cats,” covers the basics of stress and strain to ask if cats are solid or liquid. Each comic is aimed at ages 10+ and is currently available in English, Greek, French, Japanese, and Persian. [You can read "Rheology of Cats" online on their website](https://rheologycomics.github.io/).

Rob is at ICR this week to present his research and to give out print copies of "Rheology of Cats" in English and Greek. Congratulations to [Rob Campbell](https://rheoinformatic.com/members/rob-campbell), and also [Paniz Haghighi](https://rheoinformatic.com/members/paniz-haghighi.html), who translated the Persian version and provided digital calligraphy for the Persian word art!
