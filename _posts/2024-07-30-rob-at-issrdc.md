This week [Rob Campbell](https://rheoinformatic.com/members/rob-campbell) is at the [International Space Station Research and Development Conference](https://issconference.org/) here in Boston, sharing our progress developing an open source simulation platform for colloidal gel rheology in Low-Earth Orbit (LEO).

Colloid research has a long history on the ISS, and Rob has been working with existing data from NASA's public database of ISS results as well as collaborating with Calvin Zhuang and Ali Mohraz at UC Irvine on the design of new ISS experiments (launching this Saturday!). This work is helping us detangle how particle size and gravity impact colloidal gel structure and control the mechanics of polydisperse colloidal systems. 

If you're interested in how to link simulation with real world parameters, or how simulation can help predict how a material will behave in microgravity, you can find Rob during the poster session tonight, right next to the REDWIRE booth.
