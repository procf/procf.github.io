This weekend our bimodal colloid project, developed with Ali Mohraz at UC Irvine, successfully launched to the International Space Station (ISS) on Northrop Grumman's Cygnus Spacecraft!

Our science is now well on its way to orbit alongside 8200lbs of other research cargo, scheduled to dock at the ISS ~3am ET on Tuesday August 6. 

Huge thanks to our NASA, ISS National Lab, and Leidos support team Renee Bell, Shawn Stephens, Phillip Irace, Richard Edelmann, and William Therrien for getting us to space! Ali and UC Irvine PhD student Calvin Zhuang will be working closely with them and the ISS astronauts later this month to begin the experiments and downlink our first set of data.

All that data, paired with additional ground experiments and [Rob Campbell](https://rheoinformatic.com/members/rob-campbell)'s next round of simulations, will teach us a lot about how particle size and gravity impact the formation and coarsening of colloidal gel structure. This is where the fun begins!
