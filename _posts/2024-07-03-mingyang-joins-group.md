Dr. Mingyang Tan has joined the group as a postdoctoral researcher. He is interested in simulating the dynamics and physical properties of colloidal suspensions and applying machine-learning techniques to accelerate the identification of the relationship between macroscopic physical properties of soft matters and microscopic signatures of particles. Welcome to the group, Mingyang!
