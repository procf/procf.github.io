Congratulations to Milad for successfully defending his dissertation!


We are thrilled to announce the successful dissertation defense of Milad Saadat. Milad's groundbreaking work, titled "Data-Driven Frameworks for Rheology," showcases innovative methodologies that leverage neural network models to revolutionize rheological analysis. His research includes the application of Rheology-Informed Neural Networks (RhINNs) and Multi-Fidelity Neural Networks (MFNNs), as well as the introduction of Universal Fractional Integro-Differential Equation Solvers (UniFIDES). These approaches collectively offer advanced solutions for modeling, analysis, and prediction in complex fluid dynamics.

Congratulations, Milad, on this remarkable achievement and your significant contributions to the field! We look forward to seeing the impact of your work in the years to come.
