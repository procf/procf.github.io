Congratulations to Josh for successfully defending his Master's thesis!

[Josh DaRosa](https://rheoinformatic.com/members/josh-darosa) successfully defended his MS thesis, titled "Generation of Colloidal Crystals Under Pressure Driven Flow within Converging Diverging Nozzle Geometry". 
Josh's thesis introduced a novel method for forming colloidal crystals using a low particle volume fraction (10%) with a converging-diverging nozzle geometry. His simulations showed that adjusting nozzle geometry and inlet pressure controlled flow patterns, directing crystalline assembly. Utilizing Brownian dynamics and hydrodynamic inputs from OpenFOAM simulations, he found that optimal wall geometry and flow conditions were crucial for crystal formation. Excessive pressure disrupted order, but passive modifications allowed tuning of crystal size and structure. This method offers a cost-effective alternative for manufacturing colloidal crystals, presenting significant industrial potential.

Congratulations, Josh! And we wish you a bright future ahead!
