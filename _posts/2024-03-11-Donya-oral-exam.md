 Congratulations to Donya on passing the oral Ph.D. qualifying exam and becoming a Ph.D. candidate!


In her exam, Donya delved into the recent data-driven methods proposed for discovering dynamics from scarce and noisy data. Her presentation started with a physics-inspired algorithm capable of finding a symbolic expression that matches data from an unknown algebraic function, proceeded with the well-known method of sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDY), and ended with the PINN-SR method that combines PINN with sparse regression to define governing equations from scarce and noisy data. Donya showed her detailed understanding of the subject and her ability to have discussions around it.
