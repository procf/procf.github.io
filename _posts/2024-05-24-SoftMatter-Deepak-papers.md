Exciting news! I am delighted to share our two recent publications in Soft Matter, shedding light on the profound impacts of particle-level interactions on colloidal microstructures and dynamics.  In our first paper titled "Small variations in particle-level interactions lead to large structural heterogeneities in colloidal gels", we look into how minor spatial variations in particle-level interactions change the colloidal microstructures across various length scales. The second paper titled "Role of interaction range on the microstructure and dynamics of attractive colloidal systems" takes a deep dive into how large interation range shapes the colloidal microstrure and the overall state diagram.
