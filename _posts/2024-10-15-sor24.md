We're at the [95th Annual Society of Rheology Meeting](https://www.rheology.org/sor/Annual_Meeting/2024Oct/Default.aspx) this week in Austin, Texas!

Look for a packed schedule of talks from our team on Wednesday:

**Machine Leaning in the morning (Room 501)**<br>
- 10:10am, Deepak Mangal: (DR2) "Learning tensorial rheological models through neural operators"
- 10:30, Donya Dabiri: (DR3) "Obtaining rheological constitutive equations for geopolymer systems from scarce data via rheology informed neural networks (RhINNs)"
- 11:10, Safa representing Milad Saadat: (DR5) "Data-driven constitutive meta-modeling of non-linear rheology via multi-fidelity neural networks"

**Gels and Networks in the afternoon (Waterloo 3)**<br>
- 2:10pm, Deepak Mangal: (GN43) "Building a network-based approach for the rheology of reactive gels in construction materials"
- 2:50pm, Paniz Haghighi: (GN45) "Network characteristics during gelation and coarsening of attractive colloidal particles"
- 4:05pm, Rob Campbell: (GN47) "Rheology of bimodal attractive colloidal gels"
- 4:45pm, Alexander Kaltashov: (GN49) "Microstructure and dynamics of double colloidal gels"
